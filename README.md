# Deep Learning Model Analysis: Neural Network for Predicting Loan Approval

## Introduction

This analysis explores the development and evaluation of a deep learning model using a neural network, aimed at predicting loan approval outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing

### Target Variable
- The target variable for our model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, representing whether the loan application was successful.

### Feature Variables
- The features for our model include variables like `ASK_AMT`, `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, and other relevant financial and categorical data.

### Variables to Remove
- Variables such as `EIN` and `NAME` were removed from the input data as they are identifiers and do not contribute to the prediction process.

## Model Architecture and Performance

### Neural Network Configuration
- **Number of Neurons and Layers**: This configuration was chosen to balance complexity and computational efficiency.
- **Activation Functions**: The activation functions used are ReLU for the hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer, facilitating non-linear learning and binary classification.

### Model Performance
- **Achievement of Target Performance**: The model achieved an accuracy of around 73%, which is moderately successful but indicates room for improvement.
- **Steps to Increase Performance**: Adjustments such as adding more neurons, additional hidden layers, and experimenting with different activation functions were made to attempt to enhance the model's performance.

## Summary of Results

The neural network model demonstrated moderate success in predicting loan approval, achieving an accuracy of approximately 73%. While it effectively identified patterns in the data, improvements are needed to increase accuracy and reduce potential overfitting.

## Alternative Modeling Approaches

An alternative approach could involve using a Random Forest Classifier. This model could offer better performance in handling the dataset's complexity and potentially improve accuracy due to its ensemble learning nature, which aggregates multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.
